## Presentation

This project originated in the context of the graduate course *IA376N - Generative AI: from models to multimodal applications*, 
offered in the second semester of 2025, at Unicamp, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa, from the Department of Computer and Automation Engineering (DCA) of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC).

## Abstract

> Summary of the objective, methodology **and results** obtained (in submission E2 it is possible to report partial results). Suggested maximum of 100 words. 

## Problem Description / Motivation

> Description of the generating context of the project theme. Motivation for addressing this project theme.  

## Objective

> Description of what the project aims to do.  
> It is possible to specify a general objective and specific objectives of the project.  

## Methodology

> Clearly and objectively describe, citing references, the methodology proposed to achieve the project objectives.  
> Describe datasets used.  
> Cite reference algorithms.  
> Justify the reasons for the chosen methods.  
> Point out relevant tools.  
> Describe the evaluation methodology (how will it be assessed whether the objectives were met or not?).  

### Datasets and Evolution
> List the datasets used in the project.  
> For each dataset, include a mini-table in the model below and then provide details on how it was analyzed/used, as in the example below.  

|Dataset | Web Address | Descriptive Summary|
|----- | ----- | -----|
|Dataset Title | http://base1.org/ | Brief summary (two or three lines) about the dataset.|

> Provide a description of what you concluded about this dataset. Suggested guiding questions or information to include:  
> * What is the dataset format, size, type of annotation?  
> * What transformations and preprocessing were done? Cleaning, re-annotation, etc.  
> * Include a summary with descriptive statistics of the dataset(s).  
> * Use tables and/or charts to describe the main aspects of the dataset that are relevant to the project.  

### Workflow
> Use a tool that allows you to design the workflow and save it as an image (e.g., Draw.io). Insert the image in this section.  
> You may choose to use a workflow manager (Sacred, Pachyderm, etc.), in which case use the manager to generate a diagram for you.  
> Remember that the goal of drawing the workflow is to help anyone who wishes to reproduce your experiments.  

## Experiments, Results, and Discussion of Results

> In the partial project submission (E2), this section may contain partial results, explorations of implemented solutions, and  
> discussions about such experiments, including decisions to change the project trajectory or the description of new experiments as a result of these explorations.  

> In the final project submission (E3), this section should list the **main** results obtained (not necessarily all), which best represent the fulfillment of the project objectives.  

> The discussion of results may be carried out in a separate section or integrated into the results section. This is a matter of style.  
> It is considered fundamental that the presentation of results should not serve as a treatise whose only purpose is to show that "a lot of work was done."  
> What is expected from this section is that it **presents and discusses** only the most **relevant results**, highlighting the **strengths and/or limitations** of the methodology, emphasizing aspects of **performance**, and containing content that can be classified as **organized, didactic, and reproducible sharing of knowledge relevant to the community**.  

## Conclusion

> The Conclusion section should recover the main information already presented in the report and point to future work.  
> In the partial project submission (E2), it may contain information about which steps or how the project will be conducted until its completion.  
> In the final project submission (E3), the conclusion is expected to outline, among other aspects, possibilities for the projectâ€™s continuation.  

## Bibliographic References
> Indicate in this section the bibliographic references adopted in the project.
